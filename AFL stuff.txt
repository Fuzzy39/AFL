Meurrty? Concubine cankle  tooth fairy juice crush it, it probably tastes like toothpaste. 
On a rare occasion many flowers bloom at once. Itâ€™s called a bloom, because botanists or whoever are apparently defcent at naming things. 
Whatever the case may be, many have lamented the death of my late honey bee, sugar bell, though the FDA has no remorce. That honey was very questionable.
An old man muttered to himself, "If only..."
"If only", they said, louder than before, "If only I could spell a signle word in the english dictionary". Those words are truely impossible to spell, especially when
you have never learned to read the dictionary. That would seem to be a problem. 
"If only." A bright flash. They turn to look, and are immediately evescerated. What a shame.

In other news, a cow has gotten a spleen transplant, and is now incredibly skilled at icelandic rules men's handball. This year is the second year they have managed
to come out on top in the icelandic national handball tournament, and it appears they are set to participate in the Icelandic handball team in the upcomming 2024
summer olympics in paris. The olympic commision has expressed some hesitancy over whether cows should be allowed to participate, but it seems unlikely that they would
prevent the icelandic team from fielding their 'golden goose' of a cow, over fears of the controversy and scandal it would inevitably spark.
